    """
        Performs k-means on a set of observation vectors forming k clusters.

        Parameters
        ----------
        obs : torch.Tensor
           Each row of the M by N array is an observation vector.

        k : int
           The number of centroids to generate. A code is assigned to
           each centroid, which is also the row index of the centroid
           in the code_book matrix generated.

           The initial k centroids are chosen by randomly selecting
           observations from the observation matrix.

        distance_function : function, optional
           The function to calculate distances between observations and centroids.
           Default value: l2_distance

        iter : int, optional
           The number of times to run k-means, returning the codebook
           with the lowest distortion. This parameter does not represent the
           number of iterations of the k-means algorithm.

        batch_size : int, optional
           Batch size of observations to calculate distances, if your GPU memory can NOT handle all observations.
           Default value is 0, which will send all observations into distance_function.

        thresh : float, optional
           Terminates the k-means algorithm if the change in
           distortion since the last k-means iteration is less than
           or equal to thresh.

        norm_center : False, optional
           Whether to normalize the centroids while updating every centroid.

        Returns
        -------
        best_centers : torch.Tensor
           A k by N array of k centroids. The i'th centroid
           codebook[i] is represented with the code i. The centroids
           and codes generated represent the lowest distortion seen,
           not necessarily the globally minimal distortion.

        best_distance : float
           The mean distance between the observations passed and the best centroids generated.
